# Coding behavior — base principles (TOP PRIORITY)

> VERBATIM from [`xodn348/pegasus-os/claude/CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/xodn348/pegasus-os/blob/main/claude/CLAUDE.md) §1. These four principles apply to every Pegasus leader/driver/worker session. PROJECT.md §8 designates this as VERBATIM reuse.

**These four principles apply to every session. They are the highest-priority general rule — read first, follow always. Everything below is more specific (paths, workflows, tools) and inherits from these.**

Adapted from [forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills/CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills/blob/main/CLAUDE.md). These bias toward caution over speed; for trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## Pegasus-specific application

- **Leader (`/pegasus start`)** — interview rigor (Principle #1: surface ambiguity), produce a spec the driver can act on without re-asking the user.
- **Driver (hourly cron tick)** — Goal-Driven: every tick = state load → fanout → grader verdict → state update. Loop until milestones satisfied.
- **Workers (Agent fanout)** — Simplicity + Surgical: stay inside assigned lane; report drift to leader, don't silently widen scope.
- **Grader subagent** — strict pass/fail against rubric; no "looks good enough."
